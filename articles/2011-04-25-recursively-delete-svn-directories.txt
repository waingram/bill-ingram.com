title: Recursively Delete .svn Directories

Finding all the .svn directories is easy

    $ find . -type d -name .svn
    ./.svn
    ./sourceA/.svn
    ./sourceB/.svn
    ./sourceB/module/.svn
    ./sourceC/.svn

Now use command substitution with `rm -rf`. 

    rm -rf `find . -type d -name .svn`

Note the use of the _backtick_ symbol (located under the ~ on the English keyboard)&mdash;that is not a single quote.
